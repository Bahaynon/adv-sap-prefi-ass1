## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

   - The Service Oriented Architecture, it is a process or method of creation on a business application that operates reusable software components as services contains specific function and information differently. However, SOA is an interface for connecting each service with the single passage and individual place to make a unique collaboration business application development. It implies for structures and functions of the services in part of helping the userâ€™s needs.
		

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

   Standardized Service Contracts - It exposed services about the standard meaningful information that guarantee the expectation limit or policy definition and mechanism. In a form of declaring each valueable functions and purpose as service.

   Loose Coupling - Each of elements in services are more independently and least the dependency to reduce the run time event such as weakening application in a period of time.

   Abstraction - The internal part of services architecture on processing logical operations and information. It only represent the design of relationships and encapsulates the flow of a service in terms of technical implementation from the view of users. 

   Service Reusability - The services are most likely to be flexible by reusing its services as not to repeat the elements from the beginning and make a something new. This can reuse over the business process to add and update the elements and also avoids the waste of time.  

   Autonomy - The services has the right own control for its logic and contained only by itself. A service must independent and not controlled by other services.

   Statelessness - Maintaining the minimal overhead state of information and should not be able to have preserved when implementing a services.

   Discoverability - In reusing a service, it is enable to be a viewable data that stores in a service to maximize its use. Including manageble, consumeble and find easily the data.

   Composability - This involves the ability of different services that combines to create a effective relationship and be a flexible structure in a business processes. Components of services are interconnected to support each other in defining the solutions with as a whole function. 

   Interoperability - Services are accessible for overall control by the different software platform. Enabling the content of services communicates with other service to use in various business purpose that leads in collaboration.


3. Define Microservices.
   
   -The Microservices is an popular architecture based on its approach in using as a software for building single application and makes it efficiently. According to the scalability of microservices, the bigger application make up to the smaller that splits for each service aligned with the single function. Lastly, it is self based or independent operate service.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
   
   Independently Deployable - The services are smaller and independent for making it easier to comprehend and test the system operates in single function. This reducing the complexity to analyze by a smaller code base.

   Right tool for the job - A microservices provides small application and appopriate tools for error isolation and continious deployment in a way of processing from the individual services.

   Precise scailing - Services are single deployed and organizations decides which service will be deployed. Lessen the chance of fragidity that might lands in software malfunction. 


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

   Similarities
     - Made up of loosely coupled, reusable, and specialized components 
     - Deployment and building applications applied in both services 
     - Usage of services as software components
     - Data Duplication in SOA are rare for all applications and microservices data securing the individually complexity.

   Differences
     - SOA is enterprise wide software rather than Microservice that is use base for single application only.
     - Microservices are smaller and independent but can be deployed easily than SOA because of its code base. 
     - Communication specified in SOA are mostly to have rigidity each service by Enterprise Service Bus.
     - SOA is not independently deployed but collaboratively in developing business application.
     - Microservices lessening the chance to have duplication, unlikely to the SOA operates slowly base on speed.
